For personal use (ie, not in scripts) I rec
ommend nano. A somewhat controversial choice
among frequent terminal users, but unlike viand
vim, nano isn't modal (ie, it's going to work the way
you would expect a graphical text editor to work). Using
nano will let you perform all three actions (create
the file, edit the text, and view it) all with one command. Your syntax will be nano /path/to/file.txt. Of course, you can also use vi or vim, but if you choose to you definitely need to read about how first (if you're coming from a graphical background you've almost certainly never even heard of a modal editor before).
